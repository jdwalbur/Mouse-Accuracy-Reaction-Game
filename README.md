# JW-Final-Project-Graphics

The only requirements need to run this program is to copy the repo to your computer.

This program is a mouse accuracy/reaction time program. To start you must press space bar, this will start the game and will reset the score and game timer. Once started a message will appear at the top middle portion of the window stating which shape you should select to get points (circle or square). When you click on one of the shapes they will light up green if it is the correct shape and add 1 to your score or red if it is the wrong shape and subtract 1 from your score. Every time you click the shapes will get redrawn in different positions. This will run for 60 seconds then the shapes will disapear and you can start the game over if you wish. Your score is displayed in the top left and the time left is displayed in the top right
